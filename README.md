# golibs
The repository contains utility code that can be used by applications written in Golang. Can be called 'common utils'.

## Intention
In many services, we use the same things to instrument and support them, e.g., logging, context management, transformations, syncs, etc. We collect them in one place to avoid copy-paste and form a common place for the code that multiple services can use.

## Rules
- the folders in the root have names of the class of objects or the functionality it works with: `contexts`, `sync`, `logging` etc.
- all commits should be reviewed.
- changes in the utilities should be incremental and backward compatible. Use a new name/package path if you add functionality incompatible with the existing one.
